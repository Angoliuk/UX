      <p>Kaguya Shinomiya (四宮しのみや かぐや, Shinomiya Kaguya) is the main female protagonist of the series. She is a student at Shuchi'in senior highschool and the vice president of the student council in the academy.</p>
      <h2 class="section-name">Appearance</h2>
      <p>Kaguya is a beautiful young girl with long black hair, white skin, a slim build, red eyes, and always has her hair tied with a ribbon. In the past before, she entered the student council and has always worn her hair down without the iconic
        red ribbon. It is yet unrevealed if there is an extensive history behind this change in image.</p>
      <h2 class="section-name">Personality</h2>
      <p>Kaguya was a very cold and rational individual and only started to warm up to others after joining the student council. After joining the student council, She considered Miyuki Shirogane as one she would be fine to be in a relationship with
        if, and only if, he confesses first, thus she constantly plays mind games in trying to get Miyuki to confess. Later in the series her actions imply that she is starting to accept her feelings of liking Miyuki, but she still doesn't openly
        admit it.
        She considers herself as not a good person and as such she has a longing for true kindness that borders on obsession which she found in Miyuki. She cares about the members of the student council and considers them as treasured friends.
        Kaguya suffers from mood-swings as a result of her upbringing, with the various moods having their own distinct pseudo-personalities that occasionally act out mental court cases in her head. Note that this is a visual representation of her
        psyche.
        It has been shown that when Kaguya is under a cold, her basic, human desires skyrocket as a result of her brain not being as functional as it usually is, thus making her ego fundamentally dormant while her id takes over. Chika describes this
        state as akin to a "baby" and Kaguya herself has no recollection of any events during this state.</p>
