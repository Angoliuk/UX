      <p>Nanachi (ナナチ, Nanachi) is a Narehate; a person who survived the 6th layer's Curse of the Abyss, and was left deformed as a result, but, unlike most other Narehate, still retained a sound mind. Possessing vast knowledge of the Abyss - its
        ecosystem, vegetation and even the use of the medicines, Nanachi is currently a part of Riko's party, assisting her in reaching the bottom of the Abyss.</p>
      <h2 class="section-name">Appearance</h2>
      <p>Nanachi's appearance is very rabbit-like, save for a long sturdy tail, horizontally slanted pupils, carnivorous teeth and human-like hair; which is straight and white or cream in a short bobbed style, the sides of the bangs going down to
        the shoulders. In contrast, medium tan fur covers the rest of Nanachi, with light tan covering the insides of their ears and belly. They have a blush-like spot on each cheek; which has two thick whiskers protruding sideways. Other animal
        traits include a cat-like mouth with little fangs, yellow eyes with horizontal oval shaped pupils (similar to a goat's) and erect bunny ears. Their fingers are rather stubby.
        Nanachi's attire consists solely of gray-green, baggy, drop-crotch harem pants, with dark-pink hip-bags on both sides, red pant legs, and a pink flap that is supposed to cover their usually naked torso.
        Nanachi also wears a large, oddly-shaped headpiece the same colors as their pants. Attached to the sides of it are two curved horns that stick out horizontally. Hanging from the back there is a large layer of what appears to be shingles,
        covered by a layer of cream-colored animal pelts, and then another smaller layer of shingles. Strangely, Nanachi's side bangs seem to be much longer when the helmet is on, going down to their hips. They are tied at the end with metal rings.
        It is likely that these hair extensions are a part of the headpiece.
        They typically walk upright, but sometimes will run on all fours if they are trying to move quickly.</p>
      <h2 class="section-name">Personality</h2>
      <p>Most of the time Nanachi is cool and reserved, keeping their distance emotionally and physically. Their attitude often borders on being sarcastic and even cynical, however behind this mask, Nanachi hides a kind and gentle soul, capable of
        deep compassion and selfless devotion. They are also quite bashful when complimented, seen in their reaction to being called "fluffy". They also express discomfort at being petted, especially by Reg.</p>
