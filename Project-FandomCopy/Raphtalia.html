      <p>Raphtalia (ラフタリア Rafutaria?) (also ambiguously translated as Raftalia) is a Tanuki-type Demi-Human who was the first real member of the Shield Hero's party after he purchased her as a slave. She is now the Katana Hero</p>
      <h2 class="section-name">Appearance</h2>
      <p>She has undergone some significant changes throughout the story. When Raphtalia is first introduced, she is a child that has long, unmanaged hair and a dirty cloth gown. After being purchased by Naofumi, he gave her a haircut to an
        acceptable length, gave her a bath, and bought her a much more suitable set of clothes to adventure in. As a Tanuki demi-human, Raphtalia is shown to have fluffy dog-like ears and an averagely sized bushy tail.
        After several weeks of traveling with Naofumi, Raphtalia's body inexplicably changes and she gained the appearance of a beautiful teenager or young adult. It is revealed that demi-humans grow in relation to the progression of their levels,
        which led to Raphtalia's rapid development (though it is believed that she still has the mental maturity of a child, as seen when she stares enviously at children playing with a ball).
        During their travel to Other World, L'Arc mentioned to Naofumi that Raphtalia reverted back to her Child-self, for her level was reset to one and she had to grind to reach her adulthood in that world before reuniting with Naofumi. In her
        adult form, Raphtalia began to wear clothing much more fitting for a warrior, which consisted of a hide breastplate, skirt, lace-up boots and a pair of gloves. Raphtalia also switched from a small knife to a full-sized sword during this
        time.</p>
      <h2 class="section-name">Personality</h2>
      <p>Raphtalia was initially very shy, sickly, and fearful as a result of her status as a slave, as well as suffering from trauma with memories of the destruction of her village. After the encounter with the two-headed dog monster, she overcomes
        the trauma from her parents' death at the hands of the Cerberus and acknowledges Naofumi as a hero in her own mind.
        Naofumi acknowledges the strength of her heart. Despite been through a lot (for her age), from seeing her parents die, her fellow survivors and herself sold by the knights and both herself and best friend tortured to death by their previous
        owner, she managed to maintain her morals and sanity. She was hoping to reestablish her village and fight for the country which wronged her kind. This made Naofumi to take up his role as a hero seriously and to help her in the reconstruction
        of the village.
        She desired for Naofumi to act as his title of Hero and was left disappointed by many of his actions. The current Raphtalia is focused on efficiency, in both combat, training and money expenditures. Seeing this trait, Naofumi feels that he
        brought her up wrongly, as she doesn't show any girly desire for her appearance and care for efficiency. She is extremely devoted to Naofumi and harbors feelings for him which he remains oblivious to, preferring to see her as his 'daughter'
        he raises in lieu of her deceased parents. As she matures, Raphtalia not only becomes much more skilled and deadlier in battle, but she also gets much bolder, opinionated, stronger-willed and fiercely protective of her beloved Naofumi.</p>
